                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        we are creating the file requirements.txt to write

Django==3.1
psycopg2-binary==2.8.6 - for database
Pillow==7.1 - for pictures

we need to create virtual enviroments python3 -m venv env
later, we need to activate env source env/bin/activate
so, we need to install by writing pip install -r requirements.txt  in which we have django, psyco and pillow

so in order to check, we need to write pip freeze

if it is okey, we need to creade django project
 - django-admin startproject shop .  it creates manage.py and shop 
  ---- shop contains "asgi.py  __init__.py  settings.py  urls.py  wsgi.py"
